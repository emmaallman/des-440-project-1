          <p>Many consider the start of American Architecture to be the colonial style. Brought over from England to "The New World", the style features
          chimneys at the center of the home or on both sides, a gable (triangular roof), flat exterior, and thick (usually white) trimming. This style
          is mainly seen on the East Coast, more specifically the New England area.

        <p>When looking at most government buildings in America, especially in D.C., there is a shared style between all of them. Neoclassical
          style was inspired by the Romans and Greeks, where the meaning "new classic" comes from. From symmetrical floor plans, doric columns,
          and the classic centered dome roof, this style is a standout in American architecture.

              <p>Post-WWII architecture was created from leftover and used materials from the war. This causes the mixture of natural and mechanical
                materials. There was a strong emphasis on "easy living", so open concept was a main characteristic. Most homes were ranch houses with
                a strong horizontal feel to the entire design and many components were pulled from Frank Loyld Wright, such as big windows and geometric
