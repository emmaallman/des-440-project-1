        <h2>Colonial</h2>
        <h3>1600-1800s</h3>
        <p>Many consider the start of American Architecture to be the colonial style. Brought over from England to "The New World", the style features
          chimneys at the center of the home or on both sides, a gable (triangular roof), flat exterior, and thick (usually white) trimming. This style
          is mainly seen on the East Coast, more specifically the New England area.
        </p>
        <h3>Famous Colonial Homes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The March House from <i>Little Women</i></li>
          <li>Homes from The Salem Witch Trials</li>

        <h2>Neoclassical</h2>
        <h3>1780-1860s</h3>
        <p>When looking at most government buildings in America, especially in D.C., there is a shared style between all of them. Neoclassical
          style was inspired by the Romans and Greeks, where the meaning "new classic" comes from. From symmetrical floor plans, doric columns,
          and the classic centered dome roof, this style is a standout in American architecture.
        </p>
        <h3>Famous Neoclassical Buildings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The U.S. Capital Building</li>
          <li>Thomas Jefferson's Monticello</li>
          <li>The White House</li>

          <h2>Victorian</h2>
          <h3>1840-1900s</h3>
          <p>With the railroad, came new materials for building homes. The Victorian style was a direct result of this. New shapes and ornamentation
            were easier to achieve and afforadable with new means of transporting materials. Victorian style features arches, pointed windows, towers,
            rounded porches, bay windows, ornamental brackets, and multiple chimneys.

        <div class="gilded">
          <h2>Gilded</h2>
          <h3>1800-1920s</h3>
          <p>The pinnacle of hihg-class architecture in America was the Gilded era. The upper class would build lavish homes, specifically in New
            York City and in Rhode Island. This style was a product of generational wealth, passed down through generations. America's richest families
            had many famous homes in this style. They are almost always very large homes with an excessive use of gold. There are hints of neoclassical
            and victorian styles in the use of columns and ornamentation</p>

            <h3>Famous Gilded homes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Vanderbilt's Breaker Mansion</li>

            <h2>Frank Loyld Wright</h2>
            <h3>1900-1950s</h3>
            <p>The most famous architect from America was, and still is, Frank Loyld Wright. He was the pioneer of modern architecture in America.
              His work stands out as it is designed on a grid and the geometric forms he creates with on it. The style is extremely modern and features
              many pan windows and usually lots of wood.</p>

              <h3>Famous works</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The Guggenheim</li>
                <li>Fallingwater House</li>

            <div class="mid-century">
              <h2>Mid-Century</h2>
              <h3>1930-1960s</h3>
              <p>Post-WWII architecture was created from leftover and used materials from the war. This causes the mixture of natural and mechanical
                materials. There was a strong emphasis on "easy living", so open concept was a main characteristic. Most homes were ranch houses with
                a strong horizontal feel to the entire design and many components were pulled from Frank Loyld Wright, such as big windows and geometric
                shapes.</p>
